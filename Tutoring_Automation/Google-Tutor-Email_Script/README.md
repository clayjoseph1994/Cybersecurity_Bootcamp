This is a script I created for Google Scripts to be used with my Tutor Tracking Student Roster document. There are five functions: 

-One to set a checkmark function to automatically execute the intro email function when the H1 cell is checked. \
-One that creates a custom menu in sheets called Send Emails, which includes the functions intro and weekly. \
-A function to find out the last row number on the roster. \
-A function to send an introductory email based on an email template. \
-A function to send a blast email to all students on my roster. This one is set to send automatically every Friday, in order to remind students to book a tutoring session with me in the upcoming week.
