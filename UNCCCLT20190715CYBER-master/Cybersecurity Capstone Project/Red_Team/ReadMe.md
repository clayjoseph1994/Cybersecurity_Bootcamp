### Red Team 


In this activity, you will log into CybrScore and will use a Kali instance to hack into a vulnerable web server. Hidden in the web server is a file called `flag.txt`. You will need to use a reverse php shell to gain access to the web server to recover the `flag.txt` document. Once you have shown the instructor that you have recovered the flag, raise your hand and your instructor will give you a snort file from a different teams attack. 


**Part 1: Red Team Objectives**

Complete the following in order to find the flag:
- Log in to cyberscore. 
- Discover the IP address of the Linux server.
- Locate the hidden directory on the server.
- Brute force the password for the hidden directory.
- Break the hash password with John the Ripper
- Connect to the server via Webdav.
- Upload a reverse php connection payload.
- Capture and show the flag to your instructor.
- Show your instructor once you have captured the flag, and they will send you the snort log for the next part of the capstone. 
- Note: You need to complete **each** step for full credit. 


Make sure to take screenshots as you work through this to show in your presentation.
