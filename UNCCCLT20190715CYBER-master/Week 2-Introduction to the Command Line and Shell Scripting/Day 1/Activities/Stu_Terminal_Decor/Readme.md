## Instructions:

  * Using *only* the terminal, complete the following tasks:

    1. Create a folder on the desktop called **My_House**.
    2. Inside the **My_House** folder, create three subfolders: **Bedroom**, **Living_Room**, and **Kitchen**.
    3. Navigate into the **Living_Room** folder and create two files called **tv.txt** and **sofa.txt**.
    4. Navigate into the **Kitchen** folder and create two files called **oven.txt** and **sink.txt**.
    5. Navigate into the **Bedroom** folder and create a file called **bed.txt** and a folder called **Bathroom**. 
    6. Copy the **sink.txt** file from the **Kitchen** folder into the **Bathroom** folder. 
    7. Move the **tv.txt** file from the **Living_Room** folder and into the **Bedroom** folder.



  * Record all the commands you used in a new file (saved anywhere) called: **Decor.sh**. When all steps are complete, your file tree should look like the following:

    ```
    My_House
      Bedroom
        bed.txt
        tv.txt
        Bathroom
          sink.txt
      Living_Room
        sofa.txt
      Kitchen
        sink.txt
        oven.txt
    ```

* **Hints:**

  * Remember all the commands you've used so far: `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `cp`, and `mv`. 

  * We know it's painful. But believe us when we say: It's important to get good at using the command line!
